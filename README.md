# Learning Bevy
My version of the 'Advanced Hands-on Rust' workspace by Herbert Wolverson.

## Learning Objective
Since completing 'Hands-on Rust' I've tinkered with Bevy to explore its APIs and general features. By working through Wolverson's next iteration of Rust game development, I'm hoping to acquire the necessary skills to architect and develop a small game that I can share with friends while exploring Bevy. I also plan on implementing my own libraries for future games I may create in addition to exploring game engine programming by writing my own shaders and kernels through Mojo's GPU programming capabilities.
